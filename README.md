# GorgiasAPI
Was playing around with Gorgias API

Had both functions intended and wrote them up.  Wanted to create a random reply generator as a function but time was short.  Had alot of fun reading the documentation and getting better by the minute.

One of the more entertaining challenges I've done.

API key expired as Gorgias API offers a trial key - cannot go back unless I buy the service.  This was a take home test, what I would have changed was simply adding edge cases in my code and scanning user input rather than adding ticket notes with with generic titles and body content.
